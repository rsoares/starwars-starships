## What is this?

A dead simple app using just web standards. No JS or CSS frameworks here!

## What does it do?

It allows people to fetch starship data from **The Star Wars API** (`http https://swapi.co/api/starships/`). The data is presented in a sortable table.

## How to use it?

Glad you asked! It should be simple. Follow these steps:

1. Clone the repo
2. From inside the cloned folder run: `npm install && npm start`
3. In your favourite browser, navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`
4. You should now see the app running! ðŸŽŠ

You can now start searching for Star Wars starships and see a few of their features, namely: **name**, **model**, **length** and **cost**.

The table is sortable by all the features. Just click the name of the feature in the table header!

Enjoy!

## Next steps?

Heh... There's a lot to do on the UX side ðŸ˜¬
